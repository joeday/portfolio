      h1.headline Hi. I'm Joe Day.
      p.white I’m a Seattle-based UX Designer focused on solving large-scale problems for large user bases. I’ve worked on Microsoft Zune, Windows Mobile, The City and Mars Hill, to name a few.
      p.white When not designing, you might find me hiking with my family and snapping lots of photos, or learning a new method to cook a steak, or writing a song for my next album. I don’t stay still for too long.

      | Ensuring people can find a local church is hard enough. We wanted to show the life of that local church while providing quick access to the information they needed. We wanted to do this with photos. Since every local church had a Flickr account, we hooked into the API to grab photos from a curated album.

      p The vision was to enable anybody in the world to watch Sunday services online. The solution was a fully immerseive experience with a rich feature set: user-localized time zone, interactive user map, promo carousel, multiple media view options, note taking, video pre-roll, recent sermons, countdown timer, and more.

      | Upgrade from Flash to HTML5 because the primary value of marshill.com is the video sermons. Flash and mobile are always at odds with one another, and we knew HTML5 was mature enough to do all the things we needed to do. Things like closed captioning, low-bandwidth, audio-only, fully customized controls and responsive. We completely rearchitected how we do video for this project.

      h3 Why show the login screen?
      p.small Because details. Notice my username is not autocorrected or autocapitalized? I don't know about you, but when a login screen autocorrects my username, I go a bit crazy and am tempted to throw my phone at the developer! Especially, because I know how easy it is to avoid. Here's a freebie to keep your users happy: 
      code &lt;input auotcapitalize="off" autocorrect="off"&gt;

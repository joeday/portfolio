      h1.headline Hi. I'm Joe Day.
      p.white I’m a Seattle-based UX Designer focused on solving large-scale problems for large user bases. I’ve worked on Microsoft Zune, Windows Mobile, The City and Mars Hill, to name a few.
      p.white When not designing, you might find me hiking with my family and snapping lots of photos, or learning a new method to cook a steak, or writing a song for my next album. I don’t stay still for too long.
